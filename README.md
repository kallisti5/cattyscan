How do I compile the CattyScan tools?
---
CattyScan uses the scons build system. Most users can enter
the base cattyscan directory and run scons to build the toolset

Where can I get the vicious software database?
---
While the CattyScan application is fully open source, the malicious
software database is not. It takes large amounts of time to collect
and analyze malicious software. It is extremely likely CattyScan.net
will change a nominal fee for access to the latest vicious software
database. (nominal is as it sounds, the fee will be extremely small
and the licensing will be per CattyScan user (not per computer)).
This fee is to cover the operation of the CattyScan network as well
as upkeep of the malicious software database.

During the extremely early development stage of CattyScan, a free
malicious software database will be available for testing.
